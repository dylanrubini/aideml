## Goal

Analyze carefully the content of this research article.
I want you to provide me a complete python script in which the astrophysical N-body integration package Rebound is used to reproduce the corresponding simulation results displayed in Figure 1. Make sure you reason step by step in collecting all simulations details and parameters before writing the python script. Reproduce the figure as faithfully as possible.

## Detailed Description of Figure to be Reproduced

Figure 1 Description:

Figure 1 is composed of two primary sections—a left panel and a right panel—each conveying different aspects of the simulation results from an N-body simulation of a binary merger with an accompanying circumbinary debris disc.
	1.	Left Panel: Time Evolution of Binary Orbital Parameters
	•	Upper Left Sub-panel:
This sub-panel plots the evolution of two key orbital parameters of the binary system over time:
	•	Semimajor Axis (ab): Displayed as a blue line, this curve shows how the binary’s semimajor axis decreases over time due to tidal interactions and orbital decay, leading to a merger.
	•	Eccentricity (eb): Represented by an orange (or yellow) line, this curve tracks the change in eccentricity of the binary’s orbit. The evolution of eb provides insights into how the orbit circularizes as the merger progresses.
In addition, four distinct colored points (each with a different color) are marked on this sub-panel. These points represent snapshot times during the simulation and serve as reference markers for correlating the binary’s orbital state with the disc structure shown in the right panel.
	•	Lower Left Sub-panel:
This sub-panel shows the time evolution of the binary’s argument of periapsis (ωb). The plot illustrates how ωb changes over time, reflecting the precession of the binary orbit. The evolution of ωb is critical as it is linked to the dynamics that drive the binary toward merger.
	2.	Right Panel: Disc Inclination Profile vs. Semimajor Axis
	•	The right panel focuses on the circumbinary debris disc surrounding the binary system.
	•	Horizontal Axis:
This axis represents the orbital semimajor axis of the test particles (or disc elements), normalized to the initial semimajor axis of the binary (ab,0). It shows the radial extent of the disc.
	•	Vertical Axis:
The vertical axis indicates the inclination (i) of the disc particles relative to the binary’s orbital plane. Initially, the disc is polar with inclinations near 90°.
	•	Colored Snapshots:
Four different colors are used in the right panel. Each color corresponds to one of the snapshot times indicated by the colored points in the upper left panel. These snapshots capture how the disc’s inclination profile changes over time. For example, the inner disc regions may exhibit greater variations in inclination due to stronger dynamical interactions with the evolving binary, while the outer regions remain closer to polar.

Overall Interpretation:

Figure 1, as a whole, offers a comprehensive view of the binary merger process and its impact on the circumbinary disc:
	•	The left panel details how the binary’s orbital elements (semimajor axis, eccentricity, and argument of periapsis) evolve during the merger.
	•	The right panel illustrates how these changes influence the disc’s inclination distribution over a range of orbital radii, with time-correlated snapshots that allow one to connect the binary’s evolution with the disc’s dynamical response.

This detailed description provides the necessary context and structure for an LLM to write code that could, for example, generate a multi-panel plot using Python libraries like Matplotlib. The code would need to simulate or plot the time evolution curves on the left and the radial inclination distribution on the right, using distinct colors for the different time snapshots.
